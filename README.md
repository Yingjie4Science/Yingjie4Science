I am a Postdoctoral Scholar with the [Natural Capital Project](https://naturalcapitalproject.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University, where I am dedicated to advancing cutting-edge science connecting nature exposure to human health and developing open-source tools for informing urban planning and public health policy. As an interdisciplinary scholar, I have broad interests in ecosystem service flows, international trade, and land-food-energy-water nexus. I received his Ph.D. in Environmental Science & Policy, as well as Fisheries and Wildlife, from the [Center for Systems Integration and Sustainability](https://www.canr.msu.edu/csis/) at Michigan State University, where I studied how [telecouplings](https://telecouplingtoolbox.org/) shape global sustainability and impact nationsâ€™ progress toward [Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](https://sdgs.un.org/goals). More information about my research can be found on my [personal website](https://yingjieli.netlify.app/).
