## Summary

  Spreading hypoxic dead zones in the global coasts increasingly threatens marine ecosystem health and essential ecosystem services (e.g., fisheries, aquaculture, and recreation). 
  
  Intensive agriculture to meet increasing needs is recognized as one of the major causes for growing dead zones in the Gulf.

  However, even with substantially reduced ag activities, there is no sign of alleviating the deterioration trend, drawing evidence from China. 
  
  New driving forces, such as the booming **aquaculture** in the East coasts of China, are breeding even more algae blooms.

  Exchanging food leads to loss in both countries' coastal ecosystems.
  
  In what way can countries achieve win-win in both *food security* and *coastal ecosystem health*?
